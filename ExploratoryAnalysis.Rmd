Mouse 1.1 is a smart one. (Cf.Learning-Analysis)
On TPGS treatment.
The maximum number of trials is around 1000 (10 times 100 presses). He pressed 979 on 1000 trials. 
Among these 979 presses, 808 were the high rewarded lever and only 171 on the low lever. 
During the reversal phase (WTR), mouse 1.1 pressed 100 times the lever each 5 days. 
We can see that during the WTL session, he pressed 435/479 (90,8%) the high lever and 44/479 (9,2%) the low lever while during the reversal phase (WTR), he pressed 373/500 (74,6%) the high lever and 127/500 (25,4%) the low lever. 
The probability of success is obviously much better before the reversal. 


Graphs : 

The time of response decrease from day 2 to 5. (from 10,3s to 8s). We can see an increase of the time of response on day 6, which is the first day of reversal. Then the time of response decrease again to 8,25s.
